REACT JS CORE UI BOILER PLATE

To make it easier for beginners to learn and build applications with ReactJS + Vite
using the free version of CoreUI Admin Template. Information about Core UI can be read in
"README CORE UI.md"

This is a boiler plate for the client side (Frontend), testing can use the Backend
which we uploaded in the repository: https://github.com/wirausaha/ASPNet-api-boilerplate-dengan-refresh-JWT-token
or can be made yourself with any language and database as long as the API endpoint is the same.

The list of required API endpoints and their parameters are in the swagger.json file

Pages that have been prepared:
- Login
- Register
- User List
> List
> Add
> Change
> Delete
> Override Password

If there are parts that are in error, please report :)

Hopefully useful
